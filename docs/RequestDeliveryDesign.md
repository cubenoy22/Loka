# Request delivery design

How an application asks a rail to change something it does not own (the caret
of a native text control today; selection, focus and scroll position later),
and how the rail answers. The app-facing description is in the
[Programming Guide](ProgrammingGuide.en.md#reported-facts-and-requests); this
page holds the contract the rails implement. Source rulings: #873 (frozen
2026-09-22), the two-take bound accepted on #874, and the entry-completion
ruling from the #879 review (2026-09-23).

## Boxes

| Box | Type | Writer | Reader |
|---|---|---|---|
| fact (`cursor`) | `Reported<LineCursor>` | the node's commit seam only (`TextEditorDocument::moveCaret` / `applyReplace`) | app, through `state()` |
| request (`moveCaretTo`) | app-owned `Request<LineCursor>` (a private `NodeState<LineCursor>`) | app (`set`), rail (last-wins take: snapshot, then `None`) | rail |
| queue endpoint ([#892](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/issues/892)) | app-owned `RequestQueue<T, N>`: slot + reply + fixed ring | slot: app `post`, binding `consume`/`cancelFrom`; reply: rail; ring: endpoint `post`/advance/clear | slot: rail; reply: app; ring: endpoint only (rails never see it) |
| reply (optional, `RequestWithReply<LineCursor>::reply()`) | `Reported<Reply<LineCursor>>` inside the request handle | rail, once per take, forced publish | app |

`Reported<T>` has no `set` and no conversion to a mutable handle; Props extract
its write seat through `NodePropsBase::reportSeat`, and the request and reply
seats through `NodePropsBase::requestSeat` / `replySeat`; the Props door has one
overload per handle type and refuses a bare `NodeState`. Facts are named as
nouns (`cursor`, `offset`), requests as verbs (`moveCaretTo`, `scrollTo`).

## Settle (#882)

The EventCall contract is frozen in [#882](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/issues/882).
Its implementation series is [#883 (a, common/Null)](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/883),
[#884 (b, Toolbox)](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/884),
[#885 (c, Win32)](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/885), and
[#886 (d, macOS)](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/886).
The authoritative common sequence is in
[`RequestSettlement.hpp`](../common/app/scene/state/RequestSettlement.hpp);
[`Request.hpp`](../common/app/scene/state/Request.hpp) defines the request/reply boxes.

A rail context settles once per admitted live operation: attach, props apply,
one input action, restore/retry completion, or one deferred callback. Settle is
an operation-completion door, the platform counterpart of a tracker commit.
Nested observations (delegates, selection notifications, `EN_CHANGE`) belong
to their owner's operation; a deferred callback starts a new operation.
Cancelled operations never call a retired context. Shared helpers such as
`project`, `replaceProjection`, and `restoreCommittedProjection` return their
follow-up decision to the owner; they never settle or take requests themselves.

One settle is one entry operation with one `SettleOwner<Fact>` and seats in a
fixed order. The owner supplies `finishSettle` once and, under `TEST_BUILD`,
`fact`; each `SeatOperation<Request, Fact>` supplies the seven take doors below.
`RailOperation<T>` combines the caret seat and settle owner, inheriting
`SeatOperation<T, T>` and `SettleOwner<T>`.
`RequestSettlement<Fact>` builds `SeatRunner<Request, Fact>` values and their
pointer array on its own stack and walks them; each runner holds its binding
by value and, under `TEST_BUILD`, its trace row; `FollowUps` stays local to the
driver. The existing
single-seat entry and a two-seat overload share that walk; TextEditor uses the
two-seat overload for caret then command (#902).
Sources: [#898, ruling items 1–3](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/issues/898),
[#900](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/900), and
[#904](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/904).
The stack `RailOperation<T>` holds no context reference. The driver retains
`Node*` and a comparison-only context identity, checking
`node->getContext() == identity` at each seat entry, after each publication,
and after `finishSettle` before continuing.
This liveness wall is always on: retirement at seat k stops seat k+1, the
epilogue, and the trace without reopening the context.

The seven seat doors occur in this order; failed stages skip dependent work,
not the completion path of a still-live take:

1. `admit` re-evaluates phase, status, and ownership for each take; eligibility
   is not a cached input. Binding extraction on deferral follows the rail
   gate contract described under [Command seat](#command-seat-902).
   Empty/deferred admission skips the take, but still reaches the epilogue.
   On admission, `consume()` snapshots the request, then clears a last-wins slot
   to `None` or advances a queued slot directly to its next value (or `None`
   when empty); then check liveness ([#893](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/893)).
2. `resolve` checks binding currency. Failure is a refusal, not an early return
   that strands the phase.
3. `validate` asks the seam whether the requested value is valid.
4. `apply` performs the native write, clamp, or repair, returning a
   `RequestApplication` and follow-up decision; check liveness afterward.
5. `report` asks the seam to commit the applied value, then checks liveness.
   Build the reply from that seam result, not native apply success alone.
6. `current` checks the captured binding before publishing the optional reply.
   Publish once per take with forced update, then check liveness. A discarded
   binding receives no reply; an overwritten request was never taken and gets none.
7. `finishTake` receives the reply and original application result, performs
   post-report repair and conditional phase restoration, and returns a follow-up.
   Check liveness; the next admission reads the resulting phase afresh.

The owner's `finishSettle` runs once after both ordinary take opportunities
for every seat, folding `FollowUps` from `apply` and `finishTake` into the
completion decision.

The `formReply` overloads deduce their argument types: the same-type overload
keeps `Granted`/`Clamped`/`Refused` selection; different request and fact types
yield `Refused(pending, result)` on failure or `Granted(pending)` on success.
Replies remain request-typed; #902 adds request/fact-typed trace rows, as
described below.
Sources: [#898, ruling item 5](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/issues/898),
[#900](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/900).

`Granted` means the seam accepted that take, not that subscribers left the fact
unchanged afterward. `Clamped` records requested and applied values; `Refused`
records the reason and leaves the fact unchanged. Replies are not dirty sources.
If native apply succeeded but report refused, `finishTake` restores the native
selection/projection from the committed fact before reopening native admission.
Refusal before a successful native apply does not itself require a native write.

`FollowUps` combines `FOLLOW_NONE`, `RESTORE_QUEUED`, `SCHEDULE_RESTORE`,
`SCHEDULE_HIGHLIGHTS`, `OWNER_FOLLOWS`, `SCROLL_CLEANUP`, and `REPAINT` decisions.
Phase transitions stay synchronous in the rail; timer/selector arming belongs
in the epilogue, while cancellation/coalescing stays in the rail. Win32's
settle-scoped RETRY + UNAVAILABLE conversion belongs in `finishSettle`.
Repaint is requested only after a native write or repair; an empty request
slot alone does not justify it.

`finishSettle` returns `FOLLOW_UP_ARMED`, `FOLLOW_UP_FAILED`, or `FOLLOW_UP_NONE`.
A failed arm adds at most one refusal-only take per seat from that seat's last
admission's still current, nonempty binding: `consume()` (last-wins clear or queue advance),
check liveness/current binding, and publish `Refused(requested, EDITOR_UNAVAILABLE)`. It does not resolve, apply,
report, or write the fact. The driver returns the arm result after this tail,
so native admission stays closed until refusal publication finishes; retirement
returns `FOLLOW_UP_NONE`. A binding discarded during consumption gets no reply
([#893](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/893)).

Under `TEST_BUILD`, `testing::SettleTrace` stores a fixed-capacity history of
value rows: stimulus, admissions, take results, seam results, and fact delta.
Rows are per seat: a later seat contributes only if it took a request; its
untaken fact delta folds into the preceding candidate. Seat 0 is always a
candidate, emitted only for a take or fact change. The failed-arm
refusal shares that seat's row (at most two ordinary takes plus one refusal-only
take). Seat 0's `before` is the caller's pre-entry snapshot, never a fresh sample
at settle entry; later seats sample their entry fact after the preceding seat's
publications. `after` finalization and row append happen after the epilogue and
the failed-arm tail: each contributing candidate's `after` is the fact captured
at the next contributing candidate's entry, and the last candidate's `after`
is the owner's final fact.
Untaken later seats fold backward rather than creating rows (#902 item 8).

[#900](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/900), and
[#903](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/903).
Golden records are grouped per scenario step under each rail's PNG approval;
timer/retry counts are not golden expectations.

The bound is per seat: **two ordinary takes (each may refuse) plus at most one
failed-arm refusal-only take**. With one seat this is exactly the #892 bound,
unchanged. TextEditor's two seats have an aggregate bound of four ordinary
takes plus two failed-arm refusal-only takes (#902 item 6).

The sourceless `RequestBinding<T>` seat-only constructor, including its default
reply argument, instantiates `RequestDeclarationWall<T>` and refuses
non-coalescable or unspecialized types. Queued bindings pass the queue by
reference alongside the request and reply seats borrowed from that same queue.

## Endpoint and queue (#892)

The endpoint ruling is [#892](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/issues/892),
implemented by [#893](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/893).
`RequestQueue<T, N>` supplies fixed ring storage to the non-virtual
`RequestQueueBase<T>`, which owns the slot and reply handles. It is an app-owned
endpoint with one consumer; the rail receives a `RequestBinding<T>` and never
sees the ring. `pending()` is ring occupancy, excluding the published slot.

`RequestBinding::consume()` snapshots the slot, commits the ring head/count,
then publishes the next queued value directly, forcing publication even when
it equals the taken value. Only an empty ring publishes `None`; a plain
last-wins binding always clears to `None`. It touches no endpoint storage after
publication and returns the local snapshot. A synchronous subscriber's post
therefore follows older queued work. Both settlement sites use this door:
the ordinary take and the failed-arm refusal-only take. Cancellation uses
`clearRing()` then `cancelFrom(snapshot)` across the selected seats, as described
under [Command seat](#command-seat-902). A cancellation subscriber's repost
consequently enters the emptied endpoint. The caller is
`TextEditorNode::discardPendingRequest`, on binding change or detach.
Sources: [#892](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/issues/892),
[#893](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/893).

`post()` returns `POST_ACCEPTED`, `POST_QUEUE_FULL`, or `POST_INVALID` (`None`);
refused posts change neither slot nor ring. `POST_ACCEPTED` promises one reply
per taken post; caret priority can delay commands indefinitely (#902 item 6).
Discarded slot and ring entries receive no reply; cancellation loses reply
correlation and provides no exact dropped count. The bound is per seat: **two
ordinary takes (each may refuse) plus at most one failed-arm refusal-only take**.
Remaining work gets its next delivery opportunity at the next props apply
within the same flush, subject to admission and caret priority, using slot
publication to mark props dirty, without a queue timer.
Source: [#892](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/issues/892),
[#893](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/893).

`RequestTraits<T>::coalescable` has no permissive primary; `LineCursor` opts in,
and `EditorCommand` explicitly opts out (#902 item 1).
`RequestDeclarationWall<T>` refuses command-like or unspecialized types on all
three plain declaration routes: `StateBatchBase::CreateImmediateState`,
`ComposableNode::state`, and `NodeStateBatch::state`. This covers both
`Request<T>` and `RequestWithReply<T>`; queue declarations bypass the wall.
The check is a negative-array `sizeof` in C++98 and also a `static_assert` in
C++11+. Cost lines: each plain binding gains one pointer; the settlement driver
pays one source null check per take. A queued take mutates its endpoint's ring
and forces publication when advancing to a queued value; discard walks only that endpoint's
waiting entries on binding change/detach.
Source: [#892](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/issues/892),
[#893](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/893).

In [PR #894](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/894), the Toolbox
`smirkbench/text-editor-plain` cell audit has `settle.<step>.<row>` rows
**recorded per scenario step** by `tests/scenarios/TextEditorSettleAudit.hpp`.
Rows carry the stimulus, take outcomes, seam results, and before/after facts;
only settles with a take or a fact change are recorded. Every input step in
that cell emits a fact-changed row, including steps with no takes. This is the
settle-trace golden record; desktop scenario registration remains a follow-up,
not a claim of Win32/macOS scenario golden coverage.

## Command seat (#902)

The command ruling is [#902](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/issues/902).
The implementation series is [#903 (a0, runner and trace)](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/903),
[#904 (a, common/Null)](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/904),
[#907 (b, Toolbox)](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/907),
[#906 (c, Win32)](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/906), and
[#908 (d, macOS)](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/908).

### Residents and app door

`EditorCommand` has only `PAGE_UP` and `PAGE_DOWN` as executable residents;
`NONE` denotes an empty slot. These verbs accumulate: two posts mean two page
operations, so `RequestTraits<EditorCommand>::coalescable = 0` permits only
`RequestQueue<EditorCommand, N>`, not either plain request handle or a sourceless
binding. Undo/redo belongs to app history over app-owned lines; paste/cut/copy
belongs to a clipboard seam; select/selectAll belongs to `Request<Selection>`;
focus is separate page 3 work. Scroll-to-caret is idempotent and belongs to a
last-wins scroll request family, not this command queue (#902 item 1).

The Props door is `.command(queue)`, accepting
`RequestQueueBase<EditorCommand> &` into `command_`. It participates in Props
identity after `moveCaretTo_`, and its slot is a props dirty source. The reply
is `Reply<EditorCommand>`: `Granted(pending)` means the verb executed and
`Refused(pending, reason)` means it did not; this seat never produces `Clamped`.
The effect is the existing `cursor` fact, including native clamping; read that
fact to learn where the caret went (#902 items 2–3, PR a).

### Page target and rail pipeline

`TextEditorDocument::pageTarget(command, visibleLines, out)` computes a target
without publishing. It moves in logical rows by `max(1, visibleLines - 1)`,
saturates at either document end, and clamps the current column to the target
row's length (and at least zero), with no goal-column memory. Zero visible
lines or absent document/cursor storage returns `EDITOR_UNAVAILABLE`; a `None`
caret returns `EDITOR_INVALID_CURSOR`, and a stale line identity returns
`EDITOR_STALE_ID`. `NONE` is unavailable, and target-row decoding failures
propagate. Reaching an end can therefore execute successfully without moving
(#902 item 4, PR a).

Each rail's `bool queryVisibleLines(unsigned &out)` answers the count of fully
visible **logical** lines of the editor's unclipped frame, or declines; zero
lines declines. Height divided by line height is only a capacity when wrapping
is possible. Toolbox counts complete logical rows across TextEdit visual rows;
macOS measures whole logical rows including their layout fragments. Win32 uses
its formatting-frame height and font metrics with wrapping disabled. Null uses
a four-line fixture and a test decline mode. Cross-rail caret equality is not
claimed (#902 item 4, PRs a–d).

The rail owns `CommandOperation : SeatOperation<EditorCommand, LineCursor>`
and borrows its caret pipeline. Caret admission is split into binding extraction
and `enterTake`: check phase eligibility, endpoint non-emptiness and priority,
then open the rail's exclusion. Null and Toolbox open INPUT; Win32 opens COMMIT,
retaining its RETRY follow-up; macOS captures `completion_` and opens INPUT.
On phase deferral Null/Win32 supply the binding, while Toolbox/macOS do not.
macOS extracts its binding before the later caret-priority check, so that
priority deferral can still supply it. Resource and tracker refusals stay in
`resolve`, using the command endpoint's own identity and tracker checks
(#902 item 5, PRs a–d).

Reconcile before geometry on every rail: Toolbox uses `prepareApply`, Win32
and macOS use `ensureProjection`, so subscriber edits cannot leave geometry
and the logical target on different snapshots. Null reads the current model
and fixed fixture geometry without a native projection to reconcile. Then
query geometry, compute `pageTarget`, reuse native selection application,
report the native-clamped cursor through `moveCaret`, and pass a synthesized
`Reply<LineCursor>` to the caret `finishTake`. Selection and viewport work
remain under the rail's exclusion (#902 items 4–6, PRs a–d):

- Toolbox uses `TESetSelect` and `TEScroll` to reveal the target. A Granted page
  supersedes the saved viewport for `SCROLL_CLEANUP`, so cleanup from a refused
  key in the same settle cannot undo it; a refused report retains the old view.
- Win32 uses `EM_SETSEL` and an `EM_LINESCROLL` delta from the target row and
  first/last visible rows. Only on Granted does command `finishTake` refresh
  the selection/scroll cache before shared repair can call `restoreSelection`.
- macOS uses `setSelectedRange` and `scrollRangeToVisible` inside APPLYING.

### Priority and cancellation

One settle visits caret then command, with two ordinary take opportunities and
at most one failed-arm refusal-only take **per seat**. A command admission
requires the caret slot to be drained: invalid or `None` counts as drained.
Commands wait for the caret slot to drain; a continuous caret feed delays them.
If the slot stays nonempty at every command admission, that delay is indefinite;
`POST_ACCEPTED` promises one reply per taken post, not eventual admission
(#902 item 6, PR a and PRs b–d).

A document-list replacement or detach discards both seats; changing only one
request binding discards that seat. `discardPendingRequest` uses two passes:
first clear all selected rings without notification and snapshot slot values
into locals; then cancel command before caret. `cancelFrom(snapshot)` leaves a
changed slot untouched, preserving work posted by an earlier
cancellation subscriber. Otherwise it advances to a new ring head with forced
publication, or publishes `None` when empty. Cancellation therefore publishes
`None` or the next queued value. Same-seat reposts after `None` enter the emptied
endpoint (slot, then ring). A cross-seat post to a plain slot **equal to the
snapshot** is indistinguishable from discarded work and is cleared: this is a
known, pinned edge. Reposts are endpoint-relative; a repost into a replaced
endpoint is not delivered. Discarded work gets no reply or exact dropped count
(#902 item 7, `Request.hpp` / `TextEditor.hpp`, PR a).

### Per-seat trace

Under `TEST_BUILD`, `SettleTraceRow<Request, Fact = Request>` and
`SettleTrace<Request, Fact = Request>` type takes by request and before/after
by fact; `SettleTrace<LineCursor>` retains its name. The walk stamps `row.seq`
at append through `SettleTraceClock<Fact>`; `SettleTraceCapture<Fact>` resets
both histories and that clock together and reports overflow across them.
`TextEditorSettleAudit.hpp` merges caret and command histories by `seq`, using
the merged position in `settle.<step>.<row>`; command takes add, for example,
`seat=command requested=PAGE_DOWN` (#902 items 8–9, PRs a0 and a).

An untaken later seat contributes no row and folds its fact delta backward;
seat 0 is always the candidate, emitted only when there was a take or fact
change. Thus an epilogue or failed-arm tail that changes the fact cannot add
an empty command row to a command-free settle. A taken no-op command keeps its
row. Single-seat behavior and command-free golden records remain unchanged
(#902 item 8, PRs a0 and a).

## From AGENTS.md

- **Delivery sites.** A delivery site is the completion of an entry operation:
  a props apply, an attach, an input action's outer completion, or a retry or
  deferred completion that is itself the entry. A shared helper that several
  entries call (`project`, `replaceProjection`, `restoreCommittedProjection`)
  never takes a request; it returns an outcome to its caller.
- **Bound.** Per seat, two ordinary takes (each may refuse) plus at most one
  failed-arm refusal-only take, never another application. With one seat this
  is exactly the #892 bound, unchanged; TextEditor now has caret and command
  seats (#902). Pending work stays in the slot
  or endpoint ring; the consumption publication (last-wins `None` or direct
  queue advance) marks props dirty, so the next props apply offers delivery
  subject to admission and caret priority.
  Sources: [#892](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/issues/892),
  [#898, ruling item 7](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/issues/898),
  [#900](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/pull/900).
- **Refusal.** A request that cannot be applied (stale line identity, document
  unavailable, missing native resource) is taken and dropped; the fact stays
  unchanged. A last-wins slot reads `None` unless a subscriber reposted; a
  queued slot advances to the next value, or `None` when the ring is empty.
  Source: [#892](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/issues/892).
- **Binding change.** When the node's document binding changes (a different
  list or request seat in new Props, the end of the node's attachment), a list
  change or detach discards both seats; a single request-binding change
  discards only that seat before the new binding is installed. There is no
  replay of discarded work on attach; cancellation subscribers can post new
  endpoint-relative work through the two-pass protocol (#902 item 7).

## Where each rail consumes

Null: attach, props sync, input completion. Toolbox: `onPropsApplied`,
`finishInput`, native creation in `render`, `retryProjection`. Win32:
`syncFromNode`, outside-input `handleCommand`, the outer `WindowProc` after a
rejected input is restored, the RETRY timer handler. macOS: ordinary sync
completion, selection completion, `VIEW_CHANGE` completion, the deferred
storage-edit completion (`applyHighlights`), `UNAVAILABLE` refusal. These are
the entry completions governed by the settle contract above; shared projection
helpers are not additional delivery sites.
