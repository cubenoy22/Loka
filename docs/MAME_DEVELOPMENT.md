# MAME development workflow

The VS Code tasks provide two Retro68 application delivery paths for MAME:

- floppy tasks keep MAME running and insert a generated `.dsk` on demand;
- SCSI tasks rebuild a development hard disk and start MAME with that disk at
  SCSI ID 5.

The SCSI path is the faster default for application iteration. The floppy path
remains available for live disk insertion without restarting MAME.

## Quick start

1. Install MAME and set up the ROMs and a bootable HDA for a supported Classic
   Mac machine such as `maciici`.
2. Copy `.env-mame.example` to `.env-mame` and set `MAME_HDA`. Also set
   `MAME_EXECUTABLE` and `MAME_ROMPATH` when MAME cannot find them
   automatically.
3. In VS Code, run **Tasks: Run Task** and select
   `Build & Start in MAME via SCSI: HelloWorld` (or another example).

The task configures and builds the Retro68 application, creates the generated
`LokaDev` SCSI disk, and starts MAME. For the live floppy workflow, start
`MAME: Start` first and then run an app-specific `Build & Mount in MAME` task.
When VS Code is connected to WSL, the same tasks prepare the disk with the WSL
Retro68 tools and delegate MAME startup to the Windows PowerShell launcher.
Use Windows paths for the MAME executable, ROMs, and boot HDA in `.env-mame`.

## Configuration

Copy `.env-mame.example` to `.env-mame` and set at least `MAME_HDA`. The file
is local and ignored by Git. `MAME_HDA` is a **template, never a runtime disk**:
it seeds `build/mame-dev/LokaDev.hd` and the per-run boot copies, and nothing in
this repository boots it directly. To change what the template contains, work in
a boot copy and promote it deliberately — an accidental promotion is exactly the
failure this rule prevents.

Set `RETRO68_BUILD_DIR` in the environment when the Retro68 build is not under
`~/Retro68-build` or `~/Retro68`. `RETRO68_TOOLCHAIN_BIN` may also be set in
`.env-mame` when the host `hformat`, `hcopy`, and `humount` tools are not on
`PATH` or in one of the standard Retro68 build locations.

## SCSI workflow

Run `Build & Start in MAME via SCSI: <App>`. The task:

1. builds the app's Retro68 `_APPL` target;
2. copies the configured boot HDA to a temporary generated image;
3. preserves its Apple partition map and SCSI driver partition;
4. reformats only the first HFS partition as `LokaDev`;
5. copies the Retro68 MacBinary app and any requested plain data files into
   that partition; and
6. starts MAME with the boot disk as `hard1` and `LokaDev` as `hard2`.

Stop MAME before rebuilding the SCSI development disk. A fixed SCSI disk is
not safe to rewrite while the emulator has it open.

The development-disk scripts keep their original one-argument form and accept
additional plain data files after the app. For example, ScrapbookUI ships its
LRPK package beside the application:

```sh
./scripts/mame-dev-disk.sh \
  build/retro68/68k/Release/example/ScrapbookUI/ScrapbookUI68K.bin \
  example/ScrapbookUI/ASSETS.LRP
```

The PowerShell twin accepts the same positional arguments.

### Scrapbook standalone Flow

The TEST-only `LokaScrapbookStandaloneFlow68K_APPL` target launches a
compiled presentation plan without `LokaTest.cfg`, Snap artifacts, or a host
scenario controller. It advances through the Scrapbook pages using stable
TEST_ID selectors and real Button actions, then holds the final page until the
user quits.

In VS Code, run **Stage & Start in MAME via SCSI: Scrapbook Standalone Flow**.
The task builds and stages the excluded target, then puts the staged MacBinary
plus `ASSETS.LRP` on the generated `LokaDev` disk. Open the application from
that disk after Classic Mac OS boots. This presentation target is for human
observation; it does not replace the config-required machine-verdict scenarios
described below.

For a transportable artifact without changing the configured MAME disks, run
**Stage: Toolbox 68K Standalone Flow Release**. It builds the same target and
failure-atomically publishes its MacBinary, `ASSETS.LRP`, instructions, and a
self-contained HFS `.dsk` under `build/presentation/toolbox-68k-release`. The
`.dsk` contains both the application and assets and can be transferred to real
hardware or mounted live in MAME. The MacBinary and separate assets remain the
inputs for copying to an existing HFS volume or generating a local MAME SCSI
development disk. See the staged `README.md` (sourced from
`docs/TOOLBOX_STANDALONE_FLOW.md`) for both routes.

### HelloWorld standalone Flow

The TEST-only `LokaHelloStandaloneFlow68K_APPL` target presents the same typed
`toggle-action-probe` used by the machine-verdict rail without requiring
`LokaTest.cfg` or a host scenario controller. It presses the enabled probe,
disables it through the rendered toggle action, verifies that a disabled probe
is ignored, and then holds the final `Button enabled: no / clicks: 1` scene
until the user quits. Terminal step results are written to the application-side
`LOG.TXT` audit file; no Snap artifact or completion marker is published.

In VS Code, run **Build & Start in MAME via SCSI: HelloWorld Standalone Flow**.
The task builds the excluded target, puts its MacBinary on the generated
`LokaDev` disk, and starts MAME. Open `LokaHelloStandaloneFlow68K` from that
disk after Classic Mac OS boots. This is a human-facing presentation path; the
config-required `tests/toolbox/run-scenario.sh helloworld toggle-action-probe`
command remains the machine verdict.

After copying the application-side `LOG.TXT` back to the host, verify the
complete durable audit (all step terminals plus the embedded verdict) with:

```sh
tests/toolbox/verify-standalone-audit.sh \
  helloworld toggle-action-probe <path-to-LOG.TXT>
```

### Tutorial standalone Flow

The TEST-only `LokaTutorialStandaloneFlow68K_APPL` target presents Tutorial
Step 4 through the same typed `increment-summary-toggle` scenario used by the
machine-verdict rail. It increments the derived item summary twice, hides it,
proves that the conditional node left the scene, restores it, and holds the
final `Items: 2` scene until the user quits. It exercises no EditText path;
[#167](https://github.com/cubenoy22/Loka/issues/167) remains untouched.

In VS Code, run **Build & Start in MAME via SCSI: Tutorial Standalone Flow**.
The task builds the excluded APPL target, puts its MacBinary on `LokaDev`, and
starts MAME. Open `LokaTutorialStandaloneFlow68K` after Classic Mac OS boots.
The application writes `LOG.TXT` beside itself. After copying that file back
to the host, require a byte-for-byte match with the tracked full audit:

```sh
tests/toolbox/verify-standalone-audit.sh \
  tutorial increment-summary-toggle <path-to-LOG.TXT>
```

This is a human-facing presentation path. The config-required
`tests/toolbox/run-scenario.sh tutorial increment-summary-toggle` command
remains the automated machine verdict and settled-pixel rail.

### MineSweeper standalone Flow

The TEST-only `LokaMineStandaloneFlow68K_APPL` target presents the same typed
`new-game-twice` scenario used by the machine-verdict rail. Its fixed
caller-owned seed makes the initial board and both New Game results stable by
design; the shipping MineSweeper applications continue to derive their seed
from the clock. The presentation holds the third board until the user quits.

In VS Code, run **Build & Start in MAME via SCSI: MineSweeper Standalone
Flow**. The task builds the excluded APPL target, puts its MacBinary on
`LokaDev`, and starts MAME. Open `LokaMineStandaloneFlow68K` after Classic Mac
OS boots. The application writes `LOG.TXT` beside itself. After copying that
file back to the host, require a byte-for-byte match with the tracked audit:

```sh
tests/toolbox/verify-standalone-audit.sh \
  minesweeper new-game-twice <path-to-LOG.TXT>
```

This is a human-facing presentation path. The config-required
`tests/toolbox/run-scenario.sh minesweeper new-game-twice` command remains the
automated machine verdict and settled-pixel rail.

The MineSweeper runner owns a 120-emulated-second settle deadline because the
scenario deliberately projects two complete 64-cell replacement boards on a
68030-class guest. Callers do not need a `LOKA_SETTLE_TIMEOUT` override.

### FloppyBird standalone Flow

The TEST-only `LokaFloppyStandaloneFlow68K_APPL` target presents the same typed
`fixed-step-flaps` scenario used by the machine-verdict rail. The caller owns a
fixed seed, every idle advances exactly one 1/60-second simulation step, and
the scenario flaps and observes quantized RectSurface output only at named step
counts. Wall time affects presentation speed but cannot select a checkpoint.

Build the excluded APPL target, put its MacBinary on `LokaDev`, and open
`LokaFloppyStandaloneFlow68K` after Classic Mac OS boots. The application holds
the final checkpoint and writes `LOG.TXT` beside itself. After copying that file
back to the host, require a byte-for-byte match with the tracked audit:

```sh
tests/toolbox/verify-standalone-audit.sh \
  floppybird fixed-step-flaps <path-to-LOG.TXT>
```

The config-required `tests/toolbox/run-scenario.sh floppybird
fixed-step-flaps` command remains the automated machine verdict and
settled-pixel rail.

### Classic scenario loop reels

The TEST-only `LokaHelloScenarioLoop68K_APPL` and
`LokaMineScenarioLoop68K_APPL` targets present every registered HelloWorld or
MineSweeper scenario cell in order, wrap to the first cell, and continue until
the user quits. Like the standalone Flow applications, the reels do not read
`LokaTest.cfg` or require a host scenario controller. Both targets are
`EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`: they are human-facing presentation assets and never part of
the default build or a gating test run.

Build both excluded APPL targets from the repository root:

```sh
cmake --preset retro68-68k-release
cmake --build --preset retro68-68k-release --target \
  LokaHelloScenarioLoop68K_APPL LokaMineScenarioLoop68K_APPL
```

For MAME, run **Build & Start in MAME via SCSI: HelloWorld Scenario Loop** or
**Build & Start in MAME via SCSI: MineSweeper Scenario Loop**. Each task builds
the selected APPL, passes its MacBinary to `scripts/mame-dev-disk.sh`, and then
starts MAME with the generated `LokaDev` disk at SCSI ID 5. The equivalent
manual HelloWorld route is:

```sh
./scripts/mame-dev-disk.sh \
  build/retro68/68k/Release/tests/toolbox/LokaHelloScenarioLoop68K.bin
./scripts/mame-run.sh
```

For the MineSweeper reel, use:

```sh
./scripts/mame-dev-disk.sh \
  build/retro68/68k/Release/tests/toolbox/LokaMineScenarioLoop68K.bin
./scripts/mame-run.sh
```

For real Classic hardware, use the self-contained HFS disk images emitted by
the same build:

```text
build/retro68/68k/Release/tests/toolbox/LokaHelloScenarioLoop68K.dsk
build/retro68/68k/Release/tests/toolbox/LokaMineScenarioLoop68K.dsk
```

Stage the chosen `.dsk` with the SD-SCSI adapter's raw-image workflow, preserving
the image bytes, then present or mount that image on the Classic Mac and open
the reel application. This is the same transportable `.dsk` route used by the
standalone Flow stage; it needs no sidecar assets.

## Floppy workflow

Run `MAME: Start` once, then use `MAME: Mount .dsk (pick app)` or one of the
app-specific mount tasks. A small MAME Lua service accepts mount and eject
requests through files under `MAME_CONTROL_DIR`. The combined `Build & Mount`
tasks eject before rebuilding so Retro68 never rewrites a mounted `.dsk`.

For the standalone presentation, run **Stage & Mount in Running MAME:
Scrapbook Standalone Flow**. It ejects the current floppy, rebuilds the
failure-atomic stage, and inserts the staged self-contained `.dsk`. The same
image is also available as **Scrapbook Standalone Flow (staged)** in the disk
picker.

## Automated runtime verification

The launch scripts above provide the interactive development workflow. A
bug-specific automated scenario can wrap the same build artifacts with a MAME
Lua autoboot script. Keep scenario launchers, copied disks, logs, and snapshots
under a purpose-named directory such as `build/runtime-103/`; they are test
artifacts, not application sources.

To rerun the complete cross-example presentation rail and collect the ten settled
MAME-owned captures into one immutable run directory:

```sh
bash tests/toolbox/run-presentation-rail.sh
```

The command reruns every registered scenario and publishes
`build/mame-scenario/presentation/<run-id>/` only after all machine-verdict
checks pass and all captures have been hashed. A failed run retains its
`<run-id>.incomplete` directory and the scenario work directories for diagnosis.
Because those scenario work directories are shared, the presentation command
requires `flock` and serializes complete rails. A second invocation waits until
the first has collected and published its evidence before entering a scenario.

For an exact-commit release-preflight run, copy
`scripts/rig/toolbox/rigs/local.example.ini` to a machine-local path, point it at
the existing `.env-mame` and rig-local golden directory, then use the common
entry point:

```sh
python3 scripts/rig/loka-rig.py run toolbox-maciix \
  --ref <commit-sha> --mode flow --local-config <toolbox-local.ini>
```

The Toolbox adapter creates a detached checkout, configures and builds the
Retro68 scenario applications, validates and atomically stages the strict
rig-local golden bundle, runs every registered scenario, and collects the PNGs
plus both the presentation and common run manifests. Adapter failure retains the checkout for diagnosis;
success removes it only after manifest finalization.

Each `--update-golden` scenario capture enters a sibling `.incomplete` bake.
The official directory changes only when the bake contains every registry
entry and its one manifest binds every PNG, its producing application binary
digest, and every reference-identity field. Resuming an incomplete bake also
requires the same Git HEAD and `git status --porcelain` digest that started it;
an unattestable source tree may publish a one-shot bake but cannot resume one. A
complete bake from a different environment remains ineligible until its
printed identity digest is reviewed and separately written to the tracked
`toolbox-maciix.ini`; baking never edits that authority. Use
`--structural-audit` for contributor runs that validate the tracked audit and
capture path without claiming a pixel verdict.

### Isolate the emulator state

No run may use the configured boot HDA as a writable runtime disk — MAME writes
back to whatever it boots, and the Classic goldens are made of the System fonts
and control chrome inside that image, so a launch that mutates it silently moves
the baseline. Stop MAME, copy the configured boot HDA, and point `-hard1` at the
copy. Every launcher in this repository already does this: the scenario rail
copies per scenario, `mame-debug.sh` and `mame-run.*` copy once into `build/`
(`MAME_BOOT_HDA`, default `build/mame-run/Boot.hd`) and reuse it afterwards, so
an interactive session keeps its state and wiping `build/` resets it to the
template. Generate a scenario-local `LokaDev.hd` with
`scripts/mame-dev-disk.sh` or `scripts/mame-dev-disk.ps1`, and attach it as
`hard2` at SCSI ID 5. The source HDA and MAME installation then remain inputs,
while all mutable state stays under `build/`.

Give each scenario its own MAME directories as well:

```text
-homepath           build/runtime-<id>/home
-cfg_directory      build/runtime-<id>/home/cfg
-nvram_directory    build/runtime-<id>/home/nvram
-snapshot_directory build/runtime-<id>/home/snap
-diff_directory     build/runtime-<id>/home/diff
```

Rebuild the Retro68 `_APPL` target before preparing `LokaDev.hd`. Stop MAME
before replacing either disk; a disk mounted by the emulator is not safe to
rewrite.

### Headless by default, visible when reviewing

Use the same Lua scenario for unattended verification and a reviewer-visible
replay. Only the MAME presentation and throttle policy should differ:

| Mode | MAME options | Intended use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Headless | `-video none -sound none -nothrottle` | Routine verification without taking host focus |
| Visible | `-window -nomaximize -sound none -nothrottle` | Temporary human review of the exact automated sequence |

Booting Classic Mac OS dominates the run time. Let the boot and Finder setup
run unthrottled, then set `manager.machine.video.throttled = true` in Lua just
before the behavior that a reviewer needs to see. This keeps startup short
without making the relevant interaction flash past. A visible run may take
host focus, so do not use it as the default from WSL or an automated agent.

### Drive the emulated machine from Lua

Pass a scenario with `-autoboot_script` and use emulated time (`emu.wait`) for
sequencing. Host sleeps are less reliable because `-nothrottle` changes the
relationship between host and emulated time.

Useful MAME Lua surfaces are:

- `manager.machine.natkeyboard` for ordinary text and coded keys;
- `manager.machine.ioport.ports` for ADB modifiers, mouse axes, and buttons;
- `screen:snapshot(path)` for evidence that does not require a host screenshot;
- `manager.machine:exit()` for deterministic completion.

I/O port tags and field names are machine-specific. Enumerate them once for the
selected machine instead of assuming that a host key or mouse provider maps to
the Classic Mac input. On `maciix`, the ADB keyboard and mouse are exposed
under `:macadb:KEY*` and `:macadb:MOUSE*`. Direct field control is especially
useful for Command-key combinations that the natural-keyboard coded-text API
does not express.

Three Lua behaviors cost real time to rediscover:

- Device enumerators such as `manager.machine.screens` are not plain tables;
  generic iteration with `next()` fails on them. Index by tag
  (`manager.machine.screens[":screen"]`) instead.
- An error thrown inside the autoboot script does not stop MAME. A headless
  run then sits forever with nothing on the console. Wrap the scenario body
  in `pcall` and call `manager.machine:exit()` on both the success and the
  failure path, so a broken scenario terminates and reports instead of
  hanging the harness.
- Relative mouse deltas pass through the Mac's pointer-tracking curve, which
  is non-linear, so a computed delta does not land the pointer at a
  predictable position. Do not use the `:macadb:MOUSE1`/`MOUSE2` axes for
  positioning at all; warp the cursor through the low-memory globals instead
  (next section). The axes are also the only pointer inputs available:
  `maciix` has no ADB slot (`-listslots`), so no absolute pointing device can
  be attached, and an ioport dump shows no lightgun or positional field
  anywhere on the machine.

Finder name selection plus an emulated `Command+O` is more repeatable than
host-coordinate mouse automation for opening `LokaDev` and its application.
Once the app is running, prefer input through the real Toolbox event path. If
an exact platform failure cannot be discriminated through MAME input alone, a
small application-side event probe may be used in a temporary verification
build. Such a probe is evidence, not production code: remove it immediately,
rebuild the ordinary `_APPL` target, and regenerate the development disk after
capturing the result.

### Click at absolute coordinates: warp the cursor through low-memory globals

Positioning does not need the ADB mouse at all. Classic Mac OS keeps the
pointer state in low-memory globals, and the cursor task re-reads them at VBL
when told to; writing them from Lua warps the pointer to an exact coordinate:

```lua
local mem = manager.machine.devices[":maincpu"].spaces["program"]
local couple = mem:read_u8(0x8CF)          -- CrsrCouple
local function warp(h, v)
    mem:write_u16(0x828, v)                -- MTemp.v
    mem:write_u16(0x82A, h)                -- MTemp.h
    mem:write_u16(0x82C, v)                -- RawMouse.v
    mem:write_u16(0x82E, h)                -- RawMouse.h
    mem:write_u8(0x8CE, couple ~= 0 and couple or 1)  -- CrsrNew := CrsrCouple
    emu.wait(1)                            -- cursor task picks it up at VBL
end

local btn = manager.machine.ioport.ports[":macadb:MOUSE0"].fields["Mouse Button 0"]
local function clickAt(h, v)
    warp(h, v)
    btn:set_value(1)
    emu.wait(0.3)
    btn:clear_value()
    emu.wait(0.3)
end
```

**Never warp the cursor away in the same instant as the release.** Classic
push buttons track the mouse and fire only if the up lands inside the
control, and the warp takes effect within a VBL tick — so
`btn:clear_value(); warp(320, 20)` with no wait between them displaces the
release off the button and silently cancels the click. The press highlight
still shows, which makes the resulting non-action read as an application bug:
issue #324 was filed, investigated on two fronts, and closed over exactly
this. The `clickAt` above already pauses after release; keep that shape, and
if a scenario must park the cursor somewhere neutral afterwards, wait at
least 0.2 emulated seconds after `clear_value()` before warping. (MineSweeper's
New Game happened to fire even with a release-instant warp — see the TODO on
button release semantics — so a scenario that "works" in one app is not
evidence the shape is safe in another.)

The button still goes through the ADB ioport field, which is reliable; only
the axes were ever the problem. Verified on `maciix` under KanjiTalk 7
(#182): `warp(200, 150)` puts the arrow at exactly that pixel in the snapshot,
and `warp(16, 8)` plus a held button opens the Apple menu — the click lands
where the warp pointed. Points are stored v-first (`RawMouse` at `$82C`,
`MTemp` at `$828`); allow about one emulated second after the warp before
pressing the button. The addresses are universal 68K low-memory globals, but
other machines and System versions are unverified. Applications observe the
warped position through the normal `GetMouse`/event path, so this is the tool
for reaching a control that keyboard navigation cannot.

### Record the verification claim

Runtime evidence should name the machine, the input sequence, and the observed
result. Preserve the final snapshot and relevant console output under the
scenario directory. Distinguish the claims explicitly:

- **build-verified** means the actual Toolbox translation unit compiled and
  linked for the Retro68 target;
- **runtime-verified** means MAME booted the generated artifact and the
  automated sequence exercised the claimed behavior.

For a bug fix, the runtime sequence should mirror the failure mode rather than
merely prove that the example launched. A useful scenario states which control
was focused, which structural change occurred, and which visible or state
result proved that the surviving control remained functional.

## Source-level debugging with gdb (68K only)


A Retro68 application running from the SCSI development disk can be debugged
at source level: breakpoints by function or line, argument values, and a
multi-frame backtrace. This was demonstrated under MAME on a 68030 machine
(e.g. `maciix`) with the Tutorial example, stopping in `App::idlePolicy` with `App::consumeIdle` and
`ToolboxApp::run` resolved on the stack.

Seven things all have to be right. Missing any one of them looks like the
approach does not work at all, which is the trap this section exists to
close.

### Host requirements

This workflow needs a gdb that understands m68k. **Retro68 does not ship
one.** On Linux and WSL the distribution's `gdb-multiarch` works and is what
this was developed and verified against. macOS has no equivalent package, and
Retro68 builds there run inside a Linux container while MAME runs on the host,
so the debugger would have to be built or placed deliberately; that
combination is untested.

Linux/WSL is therefore the practical host: the Retro68 toolchain, the build
output, and the debugger all sit in the same environment, and only MAME is
reached across the boundary.

### 1. Build with debug information

The ordinary Retro68 release profile has no `-g`, so the emitted
`*.code.bin.gdb` carries symbols but no line table. Configure a separate
build directory with DWARF:

```sh
cmake --preset retro68-68k-dwarf
cmake --build --preset retro68-68k-dwarf --target LokaTutorial68K_APPL
```

The result is an `MC68000 ELF32` file with DWARF 4 whose `DW_AT_name` entries
point at the real source paths.

### 2. Find the runtime load base

The Segment Loader decides where the CODE resources land, so symbols have to
be relocated to that address. Search memory for a function whose bytes cannot
have been altered by startup fixups — one with no relocation entries across
its range:

```sh
ELF=build/retro68/68k/DiagDwarf4/example/Tutorial/LokaTutorial68K.code.bin.gdb
SECTION=.code00002   # the executable section holding application code

# bounds of that section
read -r SEC_ADDR SEC_SIZE < <(readelf -SW "$ELF" |
  awk -v s="$SECTION" '$2==s {print strtonum("0x"$4), strtonum("0x"$6); exit}')

# every relocation offset that applies to it
readelf -rW "$ELF" | awk -v s="rela$SECTION" '
  /^Relocation section/ {inseg = index($0, s) > 0; next}
  inseg && $1 ~ /^[0-9a-f]{8}$/ {print strtonum("0x"$1)}' | sort -n > /tmp/relocs

# functions inside the section with no relocation anywhere in their range
readelf -sW "$ELF" | awk '$4=="FUNC" && $3+0>=64 {print strtonum("0x"$2), $3, $8}' |
  awk -v lo="$SEC_ADDR" -v hi="$((SEC_ADDR+SEC_SIZE))" '
    NR==FNR {r[++n]=$1; next}
    { a=$1+0; sz=$2+0
      if (a<lo || a>=hi) next
      for (i=1; i<=n; i++) if (r[i]>=a && r[i]<a+sz) next
      printf "0x%08x %6d %s\n", a, sz, $3 }
  ' /tmp/relocs - | sort -k2 -nr | head -5
```

Take the longest candidate; a longer function makes a false match vanishingly
unlikely. For the Tutorial this reports
`ToolboxRectSurfaceContext::dirtyRect` at `0x00029372`, chosen from 48
relocation-free functions out of 645 candidates and 3224 relocations.

Take the first eight bytes of a clean function and pass them, with its link
address, to `scripts/mame-find-base.lua` as the autoboot script:

```sh
LOKA_PATTERN_WORD0=4feffefc LOKA_PATTERN_WORD1=48e71e30 \
LOKA_PATTERN_LINK=00029372 LOKA_STAY_ALIVE=1 \
  ...  -autoboot_script scripts/mame-find-base.lua
```

It bounds the search with `ApplZone` and `ApplLimit`, so it covers the
application heap rather than all of RAM — a few hundred KB, and a match in
seconds. The base was reproducible across independent runs for a given
binary, but it moves when the binary changes, so read it rather than
hardcoding it.

### 3. Relocate every section with one offset — then byte-verify before trusting it

Retro68 links the image contiguously from vaddr 0 (`.code00001` at `0x0`,
`.code00002` at `0xbff4`, then `.data` and `.bss`), so a single offset is
usually enough — for sections whose relative layout the Segment Loader
actually preserved at load time, which the next subsection shows how to
check before any symbol outside the scanned section is trusted:

```
add-symbol-file <elf> -o <base>
```

**The single offset is not guaranteed for every section.** The base comes
from scanning for an application-code (`.code00002`) function, and on a
multi-segment application the Segment Loader can place `.code00001` — the
Retro68 runtime: `abort`, `exit`, `_exit`, the `ExitToShell` trap patch — at
a *different* offset (`+0xAE8` observed on the MineSweeper scenario vehicle,
#398). A breakpoint planted on a runtime symbol then sits on unrelated bytes
and simply never fires, which reads as "this path is never taken".

Before trusting any breakpoint outside the scanned section, byte-verify it:
take the function's first words from the ELF (`xxd` at `section file offset +
(sym vaddr − section vaddr)`, choosing bytes not covered by a `.rela` entry)
and compare with `x/` at the relocated address in a live stop. On mismatch,
locate the real segment by scanning the application heap for those bytes and
re-derive the section's own offset. gdb's `find` works but can die mid-scan
with `Dwarf Error: DW_FORM_line_strp` when a hit resolves into a DWARF5 CU —
computing candidate addresses and `x/`-comparing them is the robust form.

### 4. Wait for the listener before attaching, without probing it

MAME holds the machine at reset until a debugger connects, so the autoboot
script does not begin until gdb continues. Attaching too early instead fails
with `Connection reset by peer`, and the window is narrow enough that
launching MAME and gdb back to back is not reliable.

Wait for the listener with a tool that reads socket state rather than opening
a connection. `netstat` does; a TCP probe does not, and would consume the
stub's single slot (see the next point):

```sh
until netstat.exe -an | grep -q "23946.*LISTENING"; do sleep 1; done
sleep 4
```

Ordinary breakpoints are what to use once attached. `hbreak` is rejected --
`No hardware breakpoint support in the target` -- and is not needed: MAME
implements a software breakpoint as an emulator-side check rather than by
writing a trap instruction into memory, so one planted before the application
is loaded survives its CODE resources being read in over that address.

Place breakpoints by symbol, not by file:line. Support-library objects link
DWARF 5 compilation units in beside the application's DWARF 4 ones, and
resolving a file:line location walks the mixed line tables and killed
gdb-multiarch in practice. Symbol breakpoints (`break App::idlePolicy`) do
not consult the line table and are unaffected; `list` and source display
still work once stopped.

### 5. One gdb session per MAME run

The stub does not accept a second connection; a reconnect fails with
`Connection reset by peer`. Even a bare TCP probe consumes the slot, so do not
test reachability before attaching — connect with gdb directly.

### 6. Reach the stub by host address, not loopback

MAME listens on the Windows loopback interface. Under WSL2 that is a separate
network namespace, so `localhost:23946` never connects. Use the host address:

```sh
gdb-multiarch -ex "set architecture m68k" -ex "set endian big" \
  -ex "target remote $(ip route | awk '/default/{print $3}'):23946"
```

### 7. Forward the script's variables into the Windows process

`scripts/mame-find-base.lua` is configured through environment variables. WSL
does not pass its environment to a Windows executable unless the names are
listed in `WSLENV`, so under WSL the launcher must export it as well or the
script aborts on the first `required()` call:

```sh
export LOKA_PATTERN_WORD0=4feffefc LOKA_PATTERN_WORD1=48e71e30
export LOKA_PATTERN_LINK=00029372 LOKA_GDB_LOG='C:\path\to\find-base.log'
export LOKA_STAY_ALIVE=1   # only when attaching gdb in the same run
export WSLENV=LOKA_PATTERN_WORD0:LOKA_PATTERN_WORD1:LOKA_PATTERN_LINK:LOKA_GDB_LOG:LOKA_STAY_ALIVE
```

Paths handed to a Windows MAME stay in Windows form; do not add the `/p`
translation flag to them.

### Worked example, start to finish

`scripts/mame-debug.sh` assembles the launch: it stages a scenario-local copy
of the boot disk, generates the development disk, forwards the variables the
Lua needs, waits for the listener, and hands over to gdb with symbols already
relocated. Everything mutable lands under `build/mame-debug/`, so the
configured boot disk stays an input.

**1. Build with debug information**

```sh
cmake --preset retro68-68k-dwarf
cmake --build --preset retro68-68k-dwarf --target LokaTutorial68K_APPL
APPL=build/retro68/68k/DiagDwarf4/example/Tutorial/LokaTutorial68K.bin
```

**2. Find the load base**

Pick a relocation-free function with the recipe above and pass its first eight
bytes and link address. This boots the application once and exits:

```sh
./scripts/mame-debug.sh find "$APPL" 4feffefc 48e71e30 00029372
# LOKA-BASE: BASE 0x0070e2a4
```

Re-run this whenever the application binary changes; the base moves with it.

**3. Attach**

Same arguments plus the base. The machine is left running and gdb takes over:

```sh
./scripts/mame-debug.sh attach "$APPL" 4feffefc 48e71e30 00029372 0x0070e2a4
```

Symbols are loaded at the offset and a breakpoint is set on `App::idlePolicy`,
which runs continuously once the application is up and so makes a convenient
first stop. Set `LOKA_BREAK` to choose a different one. Then `continue`: after
the first stop, further breakpoints, `bt`, `info args`, and `list` behave as
usual.

**4. Batch sessions without a human at the prompt**

Two optional environment variables extend the launcher for scripted use:

- `LOKA_DEV_DATA` — newline-separated plain data files (one path per line)
  copied onto the development disk beside the application. Each path is passed
  as its own trailing argument to `mame-dev-disk.sh`. A data-driven application
  such as ScrapbookUI refuses at startup without its `ASSETS.LRP`, before ever
  reaching the code under debug.
- `LOKA_GDB_SCRIPT` — a second gdb command file executed after the attach
  script, so an unattended session can plant its own breakpoints, log what it
  needs, and quit.

When gdb exits — from a scripted quit or an interactive one — the launcher
terminates the MAME it started. The stub refuses reconnects, so a leftover
emulator could only squat on the debug port and break the next run.

```sh
LOKA_DEV_DATA=example/ScrapbookUI/ASSETS.LRP \
LOKA_GDB_SCRIPT=build/mame-debug/trace.gdb \
  ./scripts/mame-debug.sh attach "$APPL" 4feffefc 48e71e30 00029372 0x0070e2a4
```

Two phases rather than one because gdb needs the base before it can place a
breakpoint by symbol, and the base is only discoverable once the application
has been loaded — which cannot happen while gdb is holding the machine at
reset waiting to be told to continue.

### Why this does not carry over to PPC

Two properties of the 68K output make the method above work, and the PowerPC
path has neither.

The 68K toolchain runs `Elf2Mac`, producing CODE resources from an image
linked contiguously from vaddr 0, so a single `-o` offset relocates every
section. The PowerPC toolchain runs `MakePEF`, producing a PEF container
loaded by the Code Fragment Manager: code and data are separate fragments
with their own loader relocations, a TOC register, and transition vectors.
One offset cannot express that mapping.

The base is recovered here by finding bytes that startup cannot have
rewritten. CFM applies its own relocations when it prepares a fragment, so
"identical in the file and in memory" is not a property one can rely on the
same way.

Nothing available understands PEF well enough to close the gap: gdb handles
the PowerPC instruction set but not the CFM container.

Treat MAME plus 68K as the rig for looking **inside** a running application,
and PowerPC as a leg for confirming that an application **runs**. Those are
different jobs; expecting the second to provide the first will disappoint.

### Known limits

- `-Os` leaves no frame pointer, so unwinding past the platform entry point
  produces a bogus outermost frame. The application frames are correct.
- A5-relative globals are not covered by this; only code addresses are
  relocated by the offset above. Reading such a global through gdb therefore
  returns the wrong memory. Function arguments and locals are frame-relative
  and read correctly, so when a global's value has to be observed, break in a
  function that receives it (or a value derived from it) as an argument.
- **Current MAME binds the stub to the loopback by default.** Older builds
  listened on every interface; current ones take `-debugger_host` and default
  it to `127.0.0.1`, which WSL cannot reach across the NAT boundary — the
  listener shows LISTENING in `netstat.exe` while the attach times out.
  `mame-debug.sh` now passes the WSL default gateway (the Windows vEthernet
  address) as the bind host — but only under WSL2 NAT networking, where that
  gateway *is* the Windows host (`wslinfo --networking-mode`). WSL1 and WSL2
  mirrored networking share the Windows loopback, and their default route is
  the LAN router, which Windows does not own as a bind address, so they keep
  the loopback default. `MAME_DEBUG_HOST` overrides the derivation entirely.
  The launcher deliberately never binds `0.0.0.0` — including through the
  override, which refuses wildcard values: the stub is unauthenticated remote
  control of the machine.
- **The stub has no 68040 description.** `-debugger gdbstub` on `macqd700`
  dies at startup with `Fatal error: gdbstub: cpuname m68040 not found in gdb
  stub descriptions` (probed on #398). 68030 machines (`maciix`) attach fine,
  so 68040-only investigations have to be reshaped onto a 68030 machine (for
  #398 the capacity trigger was reproduced by shrinking the SIZE partition
  instead) or driven with the native debugger rather than gdb.
- **The stub does not relay guest CPU exceptions.** Probed on #182 with a
  planted `__builtin_trap()` (ILLEGAL, vector 4): without gdb the same build
  bombs on screen (System Error type 11) at exactly that point, while an
  attached session with no breakpoint armed sees no stop at all — the 68k
  vectors into the system error handler and keeps running, which to the stub
  is ordinary guest control flow. A Classic bomb therefore cannot be caught
  at the faulting instruction through the stub. If exception catching is ever
  needed, read the exception vectors at runtime (`0x08` bus error, `0x0C`
  address error, `0x10` illegal instruction) and plant an ordinary breakpoint
  on the handler.
- **Mid-run stop→continue is probabilistically poisoned under current MAME.**
  The #182-era hazard was `delete`; on the current build the failure widened
  (#398 probes, 4 of 5 scripted runs): a `continue` inside a breakpoint
  `commands` block — and once even the script's top-level `continue` — dies
  with "Cannot execute this command while the target is running", after which
  the rest of the sourced file is abandoned and the machine sits wherever it
  was. The surviving session shape is: plant every breakpoint at attach time
  (reset stop), make each one terminal (no `continue` in any commands block),
  run exactly one `continue`, dump (`info registers`, `x/`, `bt`) at the
  first stop, and `quit`. One question per boot; ask the next question in the
  next session. Scope: this was observed in *sourced batch scripts* (`-x`
  command files). The FIFO-driven sampling recipe below feeds gdb through
  real stdin — a different execution path, proven on the #318-era build but
  not re-validated since the current-MAME stub changes; if it starts
  misbehaving, fall back to single-stop sessions and treat the recipe as due
  for re-validation. Note that sending SIGINT to a blocked scripted gdb makes the
  *remainder of the script* run against the interrupted target — including
  its `quit`, which reaps the emulator through the launcher's EXIT trap.
- **Avoid `delete` in scripted stub sessions.** Across the #182 probe runs,
  "Cannot execute this command while the target is running" appeared
  deterministically whenever the batch script executed `delete` — refused
  outright after a breakpoint stop, or poisoning the next `continue` when
  issued at attach time — and never blocked a session without it. To replace
  the attach-time breakpoint, override it with `LOKA_BREAK` instead of
  deleting it; after a stop, observation commands (`info registers`, `x`,
  `bt`) work. `run-wpset.sh` does use `delete` and has run green, so the
  trigger may be probabilistic — treat `delete` as hazardous, not banned.
### The watchpoint leg: freed-memory checks for real teardown

`tests/toolbox/run-wpset.sh` turns the wpset idea above into an automated
scenario leg. It derives the pattern words with the readelf recipe, runs the
find phase (caching the base per ELF content), and attaches with a batch gdb
script that stops at the *teardown* `ScrapbookPackage::close` — a breakpoint
condition (`this->open_ && this->currentBag_ >= 0`) skips the defensive
close inside `open()`, which otherwise makes the whole leg pass vacuously
with nothing armed. At the stop it reads the ui-bag, current-bag, and index
buffer addresses through `this` (DWARF member navigation works at symbol
breakpoints), arms full-range access watchpoints on all three regions
*before* the close body executes — the releases happen inside `close`, so
arming afterwards would leave the rest of the function unobserved (close
touches no payload bytes itself, so the live-at-entry watches do not
false-positive) — and then continues to the driver's noinline
`ScenarioTeardownComplete()` beacon, which is reached only after the App
and PlatformContext are destroyed. Any touch of freed bag memory anywhere
in that window fires in the log, and the verdict requires both the armed
watchpoint listing and the beacon's breakpoint hit, so neither a vacuous
arm nor an early exit can pass silently. The `control`
mode proves the mechanism can fire at all: a read watchpoint on a *live*
committed bag buffer must trip on the next redraw. The MAME gdbstub
implements gdb's Z2/Z3/Z4 packets as hardware watchpoints (wpset), so
neither mode pays the single-step penalty.

- **A wild pointer write does not necessarily bomb.** Writing through an
  unmapped address (`0xDEADBEEE` was tried) on a 68030 machine neither faults nor
  logs; the application keeps running as if nothing happened. The 68030 also
  permits misaligned word and long accesses, so the address errors a 68000
  would raise are not available either. Memory-lifetime defects on Classic can
  therefore corrupt silently rather than announce themselves, which is an
  argument for watchpoints (`wpset`) over waiting for a crash to locate them.

### The sampling leg: attributing a busy window

The stub also supports a time-sampling profiler: interrupt the free-running
guest on a wall-clock cadence, read the interrupted PC, resume, repeat.
(This recipe drives gdb through real stdin over a FIFO, which is why it may
repeat stop→continue: the batch-script poisoning documented under Known
limits was observed in `-x` sourced files. Proven on the #318-era MAME; not
re-validated since the current stub changes — if it misbehaves, fall back to
single-stop sessions.) No
instrumentation goes into the build, so the workload under measurement is the
shipping code. This is what attributed the first-launch cost on a 68030
machine to the ROM Memory Manager zone-scan loop (14 of 14 samples, with
`LokaAllocRaw`/`_NewPtr` frames on the raw stack) — an answer neither
breakpoints nor watchpoints could have produced, because nothing was known to
break on.

Two session shapes work; pick by whether the window of interest starts at a
place a breakpoint can name.

**Batch shape** — when the window opens at a known function (e.g. sampling
startup from `main`): a plain `gdb -x` script alternating
`continue &` / `shell sleep 0.5` / `interrupt` / `bt 16`. Simple, but the
pacing is fixed at script-writing time and the session cannot react to the
guest.

**FIFO driver shape** — when the window opens at a scenario event and the run
must stay unperturbed until then. The driver creates a FIFO, starts
`gdb-multiarch` reading commands from it with output to a log file, pumps
commands with `printf`, and synchronizes by grepping the log for `echo`
markers it planted:

```sh
mkfifo "$FIFO"                       # must live on ext4 — mkfifo fails on DrvFs (/mnt/c)
gdb-multiarch -q >"$OUT" 2>&1 <"$FIFO" &
GDB_PID=$!; exec 3>"$FIFO"
send() { printf '%s\n' "$1" >&3; }

# Breakpoint-free attach. scripts/mame-attach.gdb is not reusable here: it
# arms a breakpoint at attach time, and this leg requires none armed.
send "set confirm off"
send "set pagination off"
send "set height 0"
send "set architecture m68k"
send "set endian big"
send "set remotetimeout 120"
send "target remote 192.168.0.1:23946"   # host address, not loopback (step 6)
send "add-symbol-file $ELF -o $BASE"     # base from the find phase (step 2)
send "continue"                           # free-run toward the scenario event

until [ -f "$RT/click-1.flag" ]; do sleep 1; done   # marker file, not a breakpoint
kill -INT "$GDB_PID"                 # first stop: the window of interest is open
sleep 0.7

sample() {                           # <label> <run-seconds>
  send "echo \\n--- $1 ---\\n"
  send "continue"
  sleep "$2"
  kill -INT "$GDB_PID"               # SIGINT to gdb stops the guest through the stub
  sleep 0.7
  send "x/1wx \$sp+2"                # the interrupted PC (see below)
  send "x/64wx \$sp"                 # raw stack for offline reading
  send "echo \\n--- $1 end ---\\n"
  # ...grep "$OUT" for the end marker before the next sample
}
```

Hard-won mechanics, each paid for in lost sessions:

- **The interrupted PC is the longword at `$sp+2`.** A SIGINT stop lands in
  the 68k interrupt exception frame (status register word at `$sp`, pushed PC
  at `$sp+2`), and `bt` at such a stop frequently unwinds the interrupt
  context rather than the interrupted code. Read `$sp+2` for the PC and dump
  `x/64wx $sp` raw; pick return-address candidates out of the words offline.
- **Resolve addresses offline, not in the session.** Subtract the runtime
  load base and feed `addr2line -f -C` against the DWARF ELF; classify
  `>= 0x40000000` as ROM and anything outside `[base, base+image)` as
  other-RAM. The base changes with every build — re-run the find phase from
  step 2 whenever the ELF changed.
- **Align the sampling window with marker files, not breakpoints.** A
  software breakpoint planted while the target is stopped from a SIGINT does
  not fire after resume (two sessions lost to this before it was understood).
  Instead, have the scenario Lua touch a marker file when the event of
  interest happens, and let the driver free-run — no breakpoints armed at
  all — polling for the file before it starts sampling.
- **Sampling answers "where", never "how long".** Every stop/resume delivers
  a backlog of guest events that lands as real work once resumed — update
  events become paints — and the sampler will then catch work of its own
  making. One investigation reported a 13-second busy window that a
  free-running A/B run showed did not exist. Duration claims come only from
  free-running measurements — a scenario Lua taking `screen:snapshot` on a
  fixed cadence with no debugger attached — and the sampler's role is limited
  to attributing a window whose duration was established without it.

## Verification status

- macOS Tahoe: runtime-verified on Intel and Apple silicon (A18 Pro) with MAME
  0.288 on a 68030 machine, including live floppy insertion and the generated
  `LokaDev` SCSI volume.
- Windows through WSL: runtime-verified with MAME 0.287 on a 68030 machine,
  including the combined Retro68 build, generated `LokaDev` SCSI disk, and
  host-side MAME startup from a WSL-hosted VS Code window.
- Source-level gdb debugging: runtime-verified on Windows on ARM through WSL,
  with a native Aarch64 MAME 0.287 on a 68030 machine. The emulated machine ran at
  roughly 6.7x real time, so a full boot-and-launch cycle takes about two
  minutes.
