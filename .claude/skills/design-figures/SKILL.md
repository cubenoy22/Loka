description: Draw the standard set of design figures (today's path, proposed path, cast table, lifecycle state machines, PR split, alternatives) as an Artifact with inline SVG, at design-rally freeze time and again when a REFUTE lands. Use whenever a ruling is about to be frozen, a rally page is drafted, or a refutation changes the shape.

# Design figures at ruling time

A ruling is frozen on pictures, not prose. The rally page holds the argument;
the figure page holds the shape. Both are produced before asking for a
ruling, and the figure page is republished (same URL) when a REFUTE changes
the shape. First instance: #518 rally 1 v2 (2026-09-06).

## When

- **Design complete, before asking for a ruling** — the same moment as shape
  review gate 1 (AGENTS.md "Shape Review Gates"). The figure supplements the
  gate's written checklist; it never replaces it. The wall-tier,
  test-observability, and primitive-member items of that list are still
  written out. What the figure adds is the shape test: a dotted arrow in the
  picture is a weak joint the written list must then name.
- **When a REFUTE lands** — annotate the broken claims in red on the existing
  figures, add the alternative as its own figure. Never start a second page;
  the reader compares versions of one page.
- Skip it only for a change that has no new owner, path, or lifetime (a
  one-file bug fix). A "small" ruling that touches ownership still gets one.

## The standard set (one page, in this order)

1. **Today's path** — one concrete operation in one named example, traced
   from its origin to its visible or externally observable effect. For a
   rendering ruling that is a State write traced to the pixels (e.g.
   "FloppyBird: `scoreText_.set(...)`"); for an ownership or lifetime ruling
   it is the allocation, request, handle, or file path traced from where it
   is created to where it is released. Every box that holds a copy of the
   same fact is marked as a copy.
2. **Proposed path** — the same operation through the proposed design, same
   lanes, same example, so the eye can diff the two.
3. **Cast table** — roles as rows (what changed / where to paint / when /
   what is on screen …), columns "today" and "after"; every struct, field,
   enum, or function that holds the fact, marked copy / retire / new. End
   with a tally: +N new surfaces, −N retired, missing roles.
4. **Lifecycle state machines** — one per new owned thing (a row, a mark, a
   batch): birth doors, death doors, read doors, and what asserts at reclaim.
5. **PR split** — boxes per PR with the rail, the red→green test, and what
   each PR alone guarantees; arrows show which are independent.
6. **Alternatives** — when a second opinion (REFUTE, Codex, user) proposes
   another shape, draw it in the same lanes so the choice is a visible diff.

An independent second drawing is cheap and worth it: brief Codex with this
skill, the design summary, and the REFUTE findings — not your own page — and
publish its version as a separate artifact. Where the two pages disagree
(the PR split, a missing door) is where the design is still soft.

## Conventions (keep them identical across pages)

- **Lanes = owners**, left to right in the direction of the data. For the
  rendering pipeline: `STATE / TRACKER` → `BOUNDARY` → `SCENE / TRANSACTION`
  → `PLATFORM` → `CONTEXT`. For any other ruling, name the owners the fact
  actually passes through (e.g. `APP` → `WINDOW` → `SCENE` → `ARENA`). Time
  runs top to bottom.
- **Box = owner of one fact.** A fact that appears in two boxes is a copy
  and gets the copy colour. If you cannot name the fact a box owns, the box
  is decoration — delete it.
- **Colours**: plain = existing owner; amber = copy of a fact; green = new
  seat the design adds; red = retiring, or a claim a REFUTE broke.
  Dotted = a path that bypasses an owner (native thunk, side channel).
- **Tick boundary** = one horizontal dashed line across all lanes, labelled
  with exactly what crosses it. If something with a pointer crosses, say so
  in the label; that sentence is usually the ruling.
- **Label every arrow** with the operation (`markViewDirty(PROPS)`,
  `queryPaintDamage`), not "flows to".
- One concrete example per figure; no abstract "a State" boxes. Use the
  **real identifiers** from the source, not a shorthand: `scoreText_.set(...)`
  at `GameModel.hpp:163` read by the Text at `MainNode.hpp:81`, never
  `score.set(n+1)`. A shorthand hides which owner writes and which resident
  reads, which is usually the point of the figure (learned from the Codex
  independent version of the #518 page).
- **Every lifecycle state machine names the park, cancel, and reclaim
  doors**, not only birth and death: retained-detach (parking) bypasses the
  terminal DETACH path, a cancelled or forgotten entry must show where its
  pending work goes, and reclaim states what it asserts. A lifecycle figure
  without these three is the picture the REFUTE will draw for you.
- Figure captions state the claim of the figure in one or two sentences and
  name the file:line the boxes come from. The page's last line names the
  sources (issue, rally page, REFUTE findings file).

## Mechanics

- Load `artifact-design` and `artifact-diagramming` first, then author one
  HTML file in the session scratchpad with hand-written inline `<svg>`
  (`viewBox`, `currentColor`, per-SVG `<defs>` markers with unique ids,
  theme tokens for both light and dark). No libraries, no external images.
- Publish with the Artifact tool (private). Republish the **same file path**
  to keep the URL; pass a `label` naming the revision ("v2 draft",
  "REFUTE applied + candidate C").
- Link the artifact URL from the Notion rally page's leading callout and
  from the session handoff. Do not commit the figure page or its URL to the
  repository: it carries Japanese and personal links (AGENTS.md language
  rule; "no personal URLs in the public repo").
- Title the page as a name (`#518 Paint Ledger Figures`), never a caption.
  The page body may be in the reader's language; this skill and the title
  example stay in English because the file is tracked code-facing
  documentation (AGENTS.md language rule).

## What the figure must be able to say

If the proposed path cannot be drawn with boxes and solid lines inside one
lane frame — if it needs a dotted arrow, a box no lane owns, or a label like
"usually still alive" on the tick boundary — the design goes back before the
brief is written. That is the existing rule (a dotted arrow sends the design
back) applied with a pen instead of a paragraph.
