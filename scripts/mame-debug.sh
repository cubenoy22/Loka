# Launch MAME for a source-level debugging session and report how to attach.
#
#   scripts/mame-debug.sh find   <appl.bin> <word0> <word1> <link>
#   scripts/mame-debug.sh attach <appl.bin> <word0> <word1> <link> <base>
#
# `find` boots the application once and prints its runtime load base. `attach`
# does the same but leaves the machine running with the gdbstub enabled, then
# waits for the listener and hands over to gdb with symbols already relocated.
#
# The pattern words and link address identify a function with no relocations;
# see "Find the runtime load base" in docs/MAME_DEVELOPMENT.md for the readelf
# recipe that picks one.
#
# Everything mutable lands under build/mame-debug/ so the configured boot disk
# is never used as writable runtime state.
#
# Early and deliberately narrow. What it does not do, and why, so anyone
# extending it knows which parts are decisions and which are simply absent:
#
#   - 68K only. The method itself does not carry to PowerPC; see "Why this
#     does not carry over to PPC" in docs/MAME_DEVELOPMENT.md.
#   - Two phases rather than one. gdb needs the base before it can place a
#     breakpoint by symbol, and the base is only discoverable once the
#     application has loaded. Collapsing this would need the stub to survive
#     a reconnect, which it does not (#182).
#   - Overlaps mame-run.sh in loading .env-mame and normalising paths. That
#     launcher delegates to PowerShell under WSL and does no scenario
#     isolation, so it is not reusable here; only the idiom is shared. Worth
#     merging if a third launcher ever appears.
#   - Leaves build/mame-debug/ in place between runs, so the boot disk copy
#     and generated development disk are reused. Delete the directory to
#     start clean.
#   - Drives no input. Reaching a control that needs a click is blocked on
#     #182; keyboard-driven navigation is what the Lua scenarios use.
